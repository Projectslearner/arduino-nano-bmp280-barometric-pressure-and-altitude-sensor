# BMP280 Barometric Pressure and Altitude Sensor with Arduino Nano

#### Project Overview

This project demonstrates how to interface a BMP280 barometric pressure and altitude sensor with an Arduino Nano to measure temperature, atmospheric pressure, and altitude. The BMP280 sensor provides accurate readings, making it suitable for weather monitoring, altitude tracking, and environmental sensing applications.

#### Components Needed

1. **Arduino Nano**
2. **BMP280 Barometric Pressure and Altitude Sensor**
3. **Jumper Wires**

### Block Diagram



#### Circuit Setup

1. **BMP280 Connections:**
   - Connect the SDA pin of the BMP280 module to the A4 pin (SDA) on the Arduino Nano.
   - Connect the SCL pin of the BMP280 module to the A5 pin (SCL) on the Arduino Nano.
   - Connect the VCC pin of the BMP280 module to the 5V pin on the Arduino Nano.
   - Connect the GND pin of the BMP280 module to the GND pin on the Arduino Nano.

#### Instructions

1. **Circuit Setup:**
   - Wire the BMP280 module to the Arduino Nano as described above.

2. **Library Installation:**
   - Install the Adafruit BMP280 library in the Arduino IDE. (Search for "Adafruit BMP280" in the Library Manager and install it.)

3. **Code Upload:**
   - Copy and paste the provided code into the Arduino IDE.
   - Select the appropriate board (Arduino Nano) and port from the Tools menu.
   - Upload the code to the Arduino Nano.

4. **Testing:**
   - Once the code is uploaded, open the serial monitor to view temperature, pressure, and altitude readings.
   - The serial monitor will display temperature in degrees Celsius, pressure in Pascals (Pa), and altitude in meters.

#### Applications

- **Weather Monitoring:** Monitor temperature and atmospheric pressure for weather forecasting.
- **Altitude Tracking:** Calculate altitude based on atmospheric pressure readings.
- **Environmental Sensing:** Measure environmental conditions for various applications.

#### Notes

- Ensure correct wiring and connections to prevent errors or sensor malfunctions.
- Calibrate the sensor if precise altitude readings are required for specific applications.
